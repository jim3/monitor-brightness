ðŸ”† Brightness Control ðŸ”†

**Description: A simple script to control the brightness of the screen via keyboard shortcuts.**

```
# A script that gets the current brightness of the screen,
# then adds the increment value to the current brightness.
# the increment is `0.1` if the script was run with the argument "up",
# and `-0.1` if the script was run with the argument "down".
# The new brightness is then set to the new value.
